#Getting started

You will need the `react-tools` to get started playing with this little app.

To install run `npm install -g react-tools` this will add the `jsx` cli tool.

To run this run `jsx -x jsx  -w . .` this will look for anything `.jsx` and convert it to .js. It will also watch your files in the current directory and place them in the current directory.
